Stormtroopers, easily identified by their iconic white armor, make up the Emperor's powerful military. They are unyielding, with perfect aim, and have never failed a mission. Thanks to our stormtroopers, the rebel alliance has no chance in their quest for tyranny. 

### Do not panic when coming in contact with a stormtrooper ###

As a loyal citizen of the Empire, you have nothing to fear when confronted with a stormtrooper. Simply mind your own business, and there will be no need for escalation. Only speak to a stormtrooper if spoken to first, and never lie when asked a serious question.
